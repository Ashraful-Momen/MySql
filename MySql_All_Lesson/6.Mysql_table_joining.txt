    INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    CROSS JOIN: Returns all records from both tables
    
    
Below is an explanation of **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, **SELF JOIN**, and **CROSS JOIN** with their corresponding **MySQL commands** and simplified **ASCII art** to visualize how they work.

---

### **1. INNER JOIN**

An `INNER JOIN` retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables.

#### **ASCII Image**

```
Table A          Table B
+----+----+      +----+----+
| ID | Name |    | ID | Age |
+----+----+      +----+----+
| 1  | John |    | 1  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary |    | 2  | 30  |
| 3  | Paul |    | 4  | 40  |
+----+----+      +----+----+

Result (matches only):
+----+-------+-----+
| ID | Name  | Age |
+----+-------+-----+
| 1  | John  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary  | 30  |
+----+-------+-----+
```

#### **MySQL Command**
```sql
SELECT A.ID, A.Name, B.Age
FROM TableA AS A
INNER JOIN TableB AS B
ON A.ID = B.ID;
```

---

### **2. LEFT JOIN**

A `LEFT JOIN` retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match is found, `NULL` is returned for columns of the right table.

#### **ASCII Image**

```
Table A          Table B
+----+----+      +----+----+
| ID | Name |    | ID | Age |
+----+----+      +----+----+
| 1  | John |    | 1  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary |    | 2  | 30  |
| 3  | Paul |    | 4  | 40  |
+----+----+      +----+----+

Result (all from Table A):
+----+-------+------+
| ID | Name  | Age  |
+----+-------+------+
| 1  | John  | 25   |
| 2  | Mary  | 30   |
| 3  | Paul  | NULL |
+----+-------+------+
```

#### **MySQL Command**
```sql
SELECT A.ID, A.Name, B.Age
FROM TableA AS A
LEFT JOIN TableB AS B
ON A.ID = B.ID;
```

---

### **3. RIGHT JOIN**

A `RIGHT JOIN` retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. If no match is found, `NULL` is returned for columns of the left table.

#### **ASCII Image**

```
Table A          Table B
+----+----+      +----+----+
| ID | Name |    | ID | Age |
+----+----+      +----+----+
| 1  | John |    | 1  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary |    | 2  | 30  |
| 3  | Paul |    | 4  | 40  |
+----+----+      +----+----+

Result (all from Table B):
+----+-------+------+
| ID | Name  | Age  |
+----+-------+------+
| 1  | John  | 25   |
| 2  | Mary  | 30   |
| 4  | NULL  | 40   |
+----+-------+------+
```

#### **MySQL Command**
```sql
SELECT A.ID, A.Name, B.Age
FROM TableA AS A
RIGHT JOIN TableB AS B
ON A.ID = B.ID;
```

---

### **4. SELF JOIN**

A `SELF JOIN` is a join where a table is joined with itself. This is useful for hierarchical or comparison scenarios.

#### **ASCII Image**

```
Table A
+----+-------+
| ID | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | John  |
| 2  | Mary  |
| 3  | Paul  |
+----+-------+

Result (comparing IDs):
+----+-------+----+-------+
| ID | Name  | ID | Name  |
+----+-------+----+-------+
| 1  | John  | 2  | Mary  |
| 1  | John  | 3  | Paul  |
| 2  | Mary  | 3  | Paul  |
+----+-------+----+-------+
```

#### **MySQL Command**
```sql
SELECT A.ID, A.Name, B.ID AS ID2, B.Name AS Name2
FROM TableA AS A
INNER JOIN TableA AS B
ON A.ID < B.ID;
```

---

### **5. CROSS JOIN**

A `CROSS JOIN` produces a Cartesian product, combining every row from one table with every row from another table.

suppose 2 table A, B . Table A all element is connected with Table B every element . 

#### **ASCII Image**

```
Table A          Table B
+----+----+      +----+----+
| ID | Name |    | ID | Age |
+----+----+      +----+----+
| 1  | John |    | 1  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary |    | 2  | 30  |
| 3  | Paul |    | 4  | 40  |
+----+----+      +----+----+

Result (all combinations):
+----+-------+----+-----+
| ID | Name  | ID | Age |
+----+-------+----+-----+
| 1  | John  | 1  | 25  |
| 1  | John  | 2  | 30  |
| 1  | John  | 4  | 40  |
| 2  | Mary  | 1  | 25  |
| 2  | Mary  | 2  | 30  |
| 2  | Mary  | 4  | 40  |
| 3  | Paul  | 1  | 25  |
| 3  | Paul  | 2  | 30  |
| 3  | Paul  | 4  | 40  |
+----+-------+----+-----+
```

#### **MySQL Command**
```sql
SELECT A.ID, A.Name, B.ID AS ID2, B.Age
FROM TableA AS A
CROSS JOIN TableB AS B;
```

#joining with 3 tables=====================================================================
Below is an explanation of the join types (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`) using **three tables** and **revised notes** for better clarity.

---

### Tables Used:
**TableA**, **TableB**, and **TableC**

#### Table A: Customers
```
+----+----------+
| ID | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | John     |
| 2  | Mary     |
| 3  | Paul     |
+----+----------+
```

#### Table B: Orders
```
+----+------------+---------+
| ID | CustomerID | OrderID |
+----+------------+---------+
| 1  | 1          | 101     |
| 2  | 2          | 102     |
| 3  | 4          | 103     |
+----+------------+---------+
```

#### Table C: Payments
```
+----+---------+---------+
| ID | OrderID | Amount  |
+----+---------+---------+
| 1  | 101     | 200     |
| 2  | 102     | 150     |
| 3  | 104     | 300     |
+----+---------+---------+
```

---

### **1. INNER JOIN**
**Definition:** Matches rows in all tables based on the join conditions.

**Result:**
```
+----------+---------+--------+
| Name     | OrderID | Amount |
+----------+---------+--------+
| John     | 101     | 200    |
| Mary     | 102     | 150    |
+----------+---------+--------+
```

**MySQL Command:**
```sql
SELECT A.Name, B.OrderID, C.Amount
FROM Customers AS A
INNER JOIN Orders AS B ON A.ID = B.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Payments AS C ON B.OrderID = C.OrderID;
```

**Note:** Returns rows where matches exist in all three tables.

---

### **2. LEFT JOIN**
**Definition:** Retrieves all rows from the leftmost table and matching rows from other tables. If no match, `NULL` is returned.

**Result:**
```
+----------+---------+--------+
| Name     | OrderID | Amount |
+----------+---------+--------+
| John     | 101     | 200    |
| Mary     | 102     | 150    |
| Paul     | NULL    | NULL   |
+----------+---------+--------+
```

**MySQL Command:**
```sql
SELECT A.Name, B.OrderID, C.Amount
FROM Customers AS A
LEFT JOIN Orders AS B ON A.ID = B.CustomerID
LEFT JOIN Payments AS C ON B.OrderID = C.OrderID;
```

**Note:** All rows from `Customers` are returned, even if no match exists in `Orders` or `Payments`.

---

### **3. RIGHT JOIN**
**Definition:** Retrieves all rows from the rightmost table and matching rows from other tables. If no match, `NULL` is returned.

**Result:**
```
+----------+---------+--------+
| Name     | OrderID | Amount |
+----------+---------+--------+
| John     | 101     | 200    |
| Mary     | 102     | 150    |
| NULL     | 104     | 300    |
+----------+---------+--------+
```

**MySQL Command:**
```sql
SELECT A.Name, B.OrderID, C.Amount
FROM Customers AS A
RIGHT JOIN Orders AS B ON A.ID = B.CustomerID
RIGHT JOIN Payments AS C ON B.OrderID = C.OrderID;
```

**Note:** All rows from `Payments` are returned, even if no match exists in `Orders` or `Customers`.

---

### **4. SELF JOIN**
**Definition:** Joins a table with itself to compare rows within the same table.

**Example Scenario:** Compare customers who have consecutive IDs.

**Result:**
```
+----------+----------+
| Name     | Name     |
+----------+----------+
| John     | Mary     |
| Mary     | Paul     |
+----------+----------+
```

**MySQL Command:**
```sql
SELECT A.Name AS Name1, B.Name AS Name2
FROM Customers AS A
INNER JOIN Customers AS B ON A.ID + 1 = B.ID;
```

**Note:** Useful for hierarchical relationships or comparisons within the same table.

---

### **5. CROSS JOIN**
**Definition:** Produces a Cartesian product, where every row from one table is paired with every row from other tables.

**Result:**
```
+----------+---------+--------+
| Name     | OrderID | Amount |
+----------+---------+--------+
| John     | 101     | 200    |
| John     | 102     | 150    |
| John     | 104     | 300    |
| Mary     | 101     | 200    |
| Mary     | 102     | 150    |
| Mary     | 104     | 300    |
| Paul     | 101     | 200    |
| Paul     | 102     | 150    |
| Paul     | 104     | 300    |
+----------+---------+--------+
```

**MySQL Command:**
```sql
SELECT A.Name, B.OrderID, C.Amount
FROM Customers AS A
CROSS JOIN Orders AS B
CROSS JOIN Payments AS C;
```

**Note:** Use cautiously as it generates all possible combinations, leading to large datasets.
