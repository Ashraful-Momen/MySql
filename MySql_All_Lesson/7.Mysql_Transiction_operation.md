In MySQL, **transactions** are used to execute a set of SQL queries as a single unit of work. Transactions ensure **data integrity** by allowing operations to be either fully completed (committed) or fully undone (rolled back) if something goes wrong.

---

### Key Concepts of Transactions:
1. **BEGIN (or START)**: Marks the start of a transaction.
2. **COMMIT**: Saves the changes made during the transaction.
3. **ROLLBACK**: Reverts changes if there's an error or the operation needs to be undone.
4. **AUTOCOMMIT**: Determines whether transactions are automatically committed after each statement.

---

### Steps for Using Transactions:

1. **Start the Transaction**:
   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION; 
   ```
   (or `BEGIN;`)

2. **Execute Your SQL Queries**:
   Perform your INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.

3. **Commit or Rollback**:
   - Use `COMMIT;` to save the changes.
   - Use `ROLLBACK;` to undo changes if something goes wrong.

### Example of a MySQL Transaction:

```sql
-- Start the transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Insert a new user into the users table
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Deduct balance from the accounts table
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Add balance to another account
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Commit the transaction if everything is successful
COMMIT;
```

If something fails during the transaction, you can use `ROLLBACK`:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### AutoCommit Mode:

MySQL's default behavior is to automatically commit changes after each query. To disable autocommit during a session:

```sql
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0; -- Disable autocommit
```

Re-enable it when done:

```sql
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 1; -- Enable autocommit
```

---

### Example with Rollback:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 101, 2);

-- Simulate an error
UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 2 WHERE product_id = 101;

-- Check if stock went negative (error condition)
SELECT stock FROM inventory WHERE product_id = 101;

-- If error occurs, rollback
ROLLBACK;
```

---

### Savepoints in Transactions:

You can use **savepoints** to roll back a specific portion of the transaction without canceling the entire transaction.

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

-- Insert operation
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (1, 101, 2);

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT savepoint1;

-- Update inventory
UPDATE inventory SET stock = stock - 2 WHERE product_id = 101;

-- Rollback to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO savepoint1;

-- Commit remaining operations
COMMIT;
```
```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE TransferFunds(IN from_acc INT, IN to_acc INT, IN amount DECIMAL(10,2))
BEGIN
    DECLARE bal DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN ROLLBACK; RESIGNAL; END;

    START TRANSACTION;

    SELECT balance INTO bal FROM accounts WHERE account_id = from_acc FOR UPDATE;
    
    IF bal < amount THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Insufficient funds';
    END IF;

    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - amount WHERE account_id = from_acc;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + amount WHERE account_id = to_acc;
    INSERT INTO transaction_log (from_id, to_id, amount, transaction_date) 
    VALUES (from_acc, to_acc, amount, NOW());

    COMMIT;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

### Best Practices:
- Use transactions for **related operations** where **data consistency** is crucial (e.g., financial transfers, inventory updates).
- Always check for errors in queries within the transaction block.
- Use **ROLLBACK** to avoid partially completed operations if something goes wrong.
